# bikesharing

We are tasked with analyzing the Citibike data and put together a "proof of concept" business proposal.

We seek to create a trip analysis that will help key stakeholders decide on the investment.

The proposal is powered by Tableau to answer questions using data.

Following are questions we provide visual answers to:

How long bikes are checked out for all riders and genders.
How many trips are taken by the hour for each day of the week, for all riders and genders.
A breakdown of what days of the week a user might be more likely to check out a bike, by type of user and gender.

# Summary

With the data, we were able to answer all of the questions regarding proof of concept. We identified peak demand service hours, busiest days and also performed a deep dive into the users to get a feel for the services appeal.

While the data is insightful, more information is needed to determine if the service will appeal to potential users there. 
Age is a factor in the services appeal to users and comparing the age of residents would be insightful.
